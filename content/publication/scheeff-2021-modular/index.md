abstract: 'Full details on the design, development, and successful implementation of suitable synthetic strategies directed toward the total synthesis of iso-archazolids and archazologs are reported. Both a biomimetic and a multistep total synthesis of iso-archazolid B, the most potent and least abundant archazolid, are described. The bioinspired conversion from archazolid B was realized by a high-yielding 1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene catalyzed one-step double-bond shift. A highly stereoselective total synthesis was accomplished in 25 steps, involving a sequence of highly stereoselective aldol reactions, an efficient aldol condensation to forge two elaborate fragments, and a challenging ring-closing metathesis macrocyclization with an unusual Stewart–Grubbs catalyst. These strategies proved to be generally useful and could be successfully implemented for the preparation of three novel iso-archazolids as well as five novel archazologs, lacking the thiazole side chain. A wide variety of further archazolids and archazologs may now be targeted for exploration of the promising anticancer potential of these polyketide macrolides.'
