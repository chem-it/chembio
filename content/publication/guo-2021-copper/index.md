abstract: 'The copper-catalyzed reductive Ireland–Claisen rearrangement of propargylic acrylates led to 3,4-allenoic acids. The use of silanes or pinacolborane as stoichiometric reducing agents and triethylphosphite as a ligand facilitated the divergent and complementary selectivity for the synthesis of diastereomeric anti- and syn-rearranged products, respectively. Copper-catalyzed reductive Ireland–Claisen rearrangement of allylic 2,3-allenoates proceeded effectively only when pinacolborane was used as a reductant to generate various 1,5-dienes in excellent yields and with good diastereoselectivities in some cases. Mechanistic studies showed that the silyl and boron enolates, rather than the copper enolate, underwent a stereospecific rearrangement via a chairlike transition state to afford the corresponding Claisen rearrangement products.'
