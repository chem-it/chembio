abstract: 'Precise transformations of natural products (NPs) can fine-tune their physicochemical properties while preserving inherently complex and evolutionarily optimized parent scaffolds. Here, we report an unprecedented lactone-to-lactam transformation on bilobalide, thus improving its stability and paving the way for biological exploration of previously inaccessible chemical space that is highly representative of the parent structure. This late-stage molecular editing of bilobalide enables facile access to a unique library of lactam analogues with altered pharmacology. Through phenotypic screening, we identify BB10 as a hit compound with unexpected inhibition of ferroptotic cell death. We further reveal that BB10 suppresses ferroptosis by restoring the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in brain cells. This study highlights that even subtle changes on NP scaffolds can confer new pharmacological properties, inspiring the exploration of simple yet critical transformations on complex NPs.'
