Aldehydes serve as valuable building blocks in chemical synthesis. They can be readily obtained, for example, through the oxidation of alcohols, and their electrophilic nature underpins many carbon-carbon coupling reactions. However, the use of alpha-chiral aldehydes often leads to racemisation during storage or the reaction itself, rendering them less useful. Consequently, methods for the deracemisation of alpha-substituted aldehydes are warranted, as these would provide access to freshly prepared, highly enantioenriched molecules that can be directly transformed into more stable analogues.

In a recent study published in the *Journal of the American Chemical Society* (JACS), Luo and colleagues from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, described a novel method for synthesising enantioenriched alpha-amino aldehydes in situ. Their work utilised a chiral amine, which forms an imine with the aldehyde. Following enamine tautomerisation, the (*E*)/(*Z*) ratio is favoured towards the (*E*)-enamine under the influence of iridium photocatalysis, promoted by PIDA. This process ultimately leads to the accumulation of a single enantiomer.

This study is significant as it highlights the potential to deracemise a highly sensitive alpha aldehyde stereocentre, which can subsequently be stabilised through analogue formation (e.g., the Wittig reaction). From a practical standpoint, further studies will determine whether this concept can be applied in synthetic routines. Firstly, the system is highly sensitive; temperature must be meticulously controlled, and the reaction must be conducted in an oxygen-free environment. Furthermore, photocatalysis setups are still relatively rare in many academic laboratories. Although some examples achieve enantiomeric excess exceeding 90%, the typical scale is 0.1 mmol, with the *ee* of this reaction ranging between 80% and 90%. This may be insufficient for advanced total synthesis campaigns, as the outcomes of scale-up are uncertain, and the separation of enantiomers on a larger scale is less feasible, requiring chiral preparative HPLC.
